I want to use the [jdeb](https://github.com/tcurdt/jdeb)Â library to integrate in one of my own libraries.
Since it is a maven-plugin it's packaged as a maven plugin. SBT does not resolve the jars if you just add it as a
dependency. This will do the trick:

```scala
"org.vafer" % "jdeb" % "1.2" artifacts (Artifact("jdeb", "jar", "jar"))
```    


This one is for sbt 0.13.5!
