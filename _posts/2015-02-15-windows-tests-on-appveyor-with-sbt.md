For SBT Native Packager we rely on [travis-ci][travis-ci] to run our tests. However travis has not yet windows support,
so we have to run these tests manually, which is not nice. Lucky there's anotherÂ free-for-opensource
continous integration server for windows name [AppVeyor][appveyor].

## Setup your appveyor.yml

The tricky part is to install sbt and let it run your tests. There is an awesome blogpost on
[how to do it with maven][maven-appveyor].
I took the script and changed it to work with sbt instead.

```yaml
version: '{build}'
os: Windows Server 2012
install:
  - cmd: choco install sbt -ia "INSTALLDIR=""C:\sbt"""
  - cmd: SET PATH=C:\sbt\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
  - cmd: SET SBT_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=2g -Xmx4g
build_script:
  - sbt clean compile
test_script:
  - sbt validateWindows
cache:
  - C:\sbt\
  - C:\Users\appveyor\.m2
  - C:\Users\appveyor\.ivy2
```
